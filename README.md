# Remote-System-Management-and-Configuration
In this project our intention is to help the administrator to manage the all client systems from a central location and to do the activity like 
installation/ uninstallation of application, file transferring to the remote systems from a central location along with monitoring of critical services 
and processes running on the client systems and alert the administrator in any critical case like firewall is not running, etc.
